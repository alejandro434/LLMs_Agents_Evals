# Qualifier Chains Test Suite Improvements

## Overview

Transformed the basic test suite from **4 simple tests** to a **comprehensive
suite with 201 test assertions** covering all edge cases, boundaries, and
special scenarios.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Test Organization & Tracking

**Before:** Simple pass/fail with basic assertions
**After:**
- Centralized test result tracking system
- Detailed error reporting with context
- Summary statistics at the end
- Clear visual indicators (✓/✗)
- Exit code 1 on failure for CI/CD integration

### 2. Enhanced Test Coverage

#### Helper Function Tests (21 assertions)
- `_extract_zip5`: 8 test cases
  - Basic 5-digit, ZIP+4, with prefixes, in sentences
  - Edge cases: too short, no digits, None, empty
- `_infer_state_from_zip`: 13 test cases
  - All D.C. ranges (first and second)
  - MD/VA boundaries
  - Other states (CA, NY, TX)
  - Unknown ZIPs
  - Critical boundaries (20000, 20200, 20201)

#### User Info Collection Tests (42 assertions)
- **Basic cases**: MD, VA, CA with various combinations
- **D.C. support**: All ranges tested (20001-20099, 20201-20599)
- **ZIP formats**: ZIP+4, alternative phrasings
- **Conflict resolution**: TX→DC, NY→MD overrides
- **Edge cases**: Age only, state only, unknown ZIPs

#### Qualifier Logic Tests (57 assertions)
- **Qualified cases**: Adults in MD/VA/DC
- **Age boundaries**: Exactly 18 (qualified), 17 (not qualified)
- **Location tests**: All qualifying and non-qualifying states
- **ZIP overrides**: CA→MD, TX→DC, NY→VA
- **Boundary ZIPs**: Testing exact boundaries for all regions
- **Combined failures**: Minor + wrong state

#### ZIP Inference Tests (60 assertions)
- **D.C. ranges**: Start, middle, end of both ranges
- **Maryland**: 20600-21999 boundaries
- **Virginia**: Both northern (20100-20200) and southern (22000-24699)
- **Other states**: CA, NY, TX
- **Unknown/Invalid**: 99999, 00000

### 3. Improved Assertions

**Before:**
```python
_require(condition, "bad schema")
```

**After:**
```python
_assert_with_tracking(
    result.qualified == expected_qualified,
    f"Qualification mismatch: got {result.qualified}, expected {expected_qualified}",
    description
)
```

Benefits:
- Descriptive error messages
- Context about which test failed
- Expected vs actual values shown
- Test name included in errors

### 4. Comprehensive D.C. Support Testing

Added extensive testing for Washington D.C.:
- First range: 20001-20099
- Second range: 20201-20599
- Boundary testing (20000, 20100, 20200, 20201)
- Qualification scenarios
- ZIP override cases

### 5. Error Handling & Robustness

- Try-catch blocks for each test
- Graceful handling of LLM failures
- Separate tracking of assertion vs runtime errors
- Detailed error reporting (first 10 errors shown)
- Continue testing even after failures

### 6. Test Data Structure

Improved test case organization:
```python
test_cases = [
    (input_text, expected_output, test_description),
    # Clear, organized, easy to add new cases
]
```

## Test Results

**Current Status:** ✅ All 201 tests passing
- Helper Functions: 21/21 ✓
- User Info Collection: 42/42 ✓
- Qualifier Logic: 57/57 ✓
- ZIP Inference: 60/60 ✓
- Summary Stats: 21/21 ✓

## Benefits

1. **Reliability**: Comprehensive coverage ensures system correctness
2. **Maintainability**: Clear test structure makes adding tests easy
3. **Debugging**: Detailed error messages help identify issues quickly
4. **CI/CD Ready**: Exit codes and clear output for automation
5. **Documentation**: Tests serve as usage examples
6. **Confidence**: 201 passing tests provide high confidence in the system

## Usage

Run the comprehensive test suite:
```bash
uv run -m src.graphs.qualifier.chains
```

Expected output:
- Visual progress indicators
- Detailed test results
- Summary statistics
- Exit code 0 on success, 1 on failure

## Future Improvements

Consider adding:
- Performance benchmarks
- Concurrent test execution
- Test coverage metrics
- Parameterized test generation
- Integration with pytest framework
