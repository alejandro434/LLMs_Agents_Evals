# Qualifier System Improvements Summary

## Changes Applied

### 1. Fixed System Prompts (`system_prompt.yml`)

#### UserInfoCollectionSystemPrompt
**Before:** Vague instructions, incorrect ZIP ranges, no edge case handling
**After:**
- Clear ZIP processing rules with priority order
- Accurate ZIP code ranges for all states
- Specific instructions for missing information handling
- Explicit format acceptance (5-digit, ZIP+4, with/without dashes)
- Friendly, concise response templates

#### QualifierSystemPrompt
**Before:** Ambiguous rules, incorrect ZIP ranges, unclear output requirements
**After:**
- Strict, numbered qualification rules
- Clear age and location requirements
- Accurate ZIP code ranges including D.C.
- Specific, respectful rejection messages
- Explicit output schema requirements

### 2. Added Washington D.C. Support (`chains.py`)

**Before:** No D.C. ZIP code handling despite claiming D.C. residents qualify
**After:**
- Added D.C. ZIP ranges: 20001-20099, 20201-20599
- Returns "District of Columbia" for D.C. ZIP codes
- Properly handles boundaries between D.C., MD, and VA

### 3. Fixed Documentation Consistency (`schemas.py`)

**Before:** Claimed only MD and VA residents qualify (excluded D.C.)
**After:**
- Updated to include Washington D.C. as qualifying location
- Consistent messaging across all schema fields

### 4. Enhanced Few-Shot Examples (`fewshots.yml`)

**Added:**
- D.C. resident qualification example
- D.C. ZIP code inference example
- Updated rejection message to include D.C.

## Key Improvements

### Accuracy
✅ Correct ZIP code ranges for all jurisdictions
✅ D.C. residents now properly qualify
✅ ZIP-based state inference works for all three jurisdictions

### Clarity
✅ Numbered rules and clear processing order
✅ Specific instructions for each scenario
✅ Explicit format acceptance guidelines
✅ Clear edge case handling

### Consistency
✅ All components now agree on qualifying states (MD, VA, DC)
✅ Uniform terminology throughout
✅ Aligned prompts, schemas, and implementation

### Robustness
✅ Handles ZIP+4 format
✅ Accepts various ZIP input formats
✅ Proper boundary handling between jurisdictions
✅ Graceful fallback for unmapped ZIPs

## Testing Results

All core functionality verified:
- ✅ D.C. ZIP ranges correctly mapped (20001-20099, 20201-20599)
- ✅ State boundaries properly enforced
- ✅ D.C. residents qualify when 18+ years old
- ✅ ZIP code overrides conflicting textual state mentions
- ✅ User info extraction works for D.C. ZIP codes

## Impact

These changes ensure:
1. **Fair Treatment**: D.C. residents are no longer incorrectly rejected
2. **Accurate Processing**: ZIP codes map to correct jurisdictions
3. **Better UX**: Clear, friendly messages and proper edge case handling
4. **Maintainability**: Consistent documentation and implementation
