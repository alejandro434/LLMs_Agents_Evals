"""LLM-based Context Precision without reference example for Ragas.

What this measures
    Proportion of retrieved context chunks that are relevant to the
    produced `response` (signal vs. noise) without requiring gold labels.

When to use
    - Early-stage RAG experiments without annotated contexts.
    - Monitoring retrieval noise in production.

Trade-offs
    - Uses an LLM judge: cost, latency, and permissions apply.
    - Relevance is judged against the model's response (may reflect its
      errors). Use "with reference" variants when gold answers exist.

Implementation notes
    - Provide a capable judge LLM; adjust prompts via `get_prompts()` if
      domain adaptation is needed.

Run
    uv run docs/ragas/examples/context_precision_llm.py

Requires
    OPENAI_API_KEY set. Uses LangChain wrappers.
