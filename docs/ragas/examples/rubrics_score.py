"""LLM-based RubricsScore example for Ragas.

What this measures
    A rubric-driven discrete score (e.g., 1â€“5) for flexible, domain-specific
    quality evaluation with natural-language descriptors for each level.

When to use
    - Planner/Reasoner outputs needing nuanced, human-like grading.
    - QA sign-off criteria encoded in a consistent automated evaluator.

Trade-offs
    - Requires careful rubric design; LLM cost applies.
    - Less granular than continuous scores but more interpretable.

Implementation notes
    - Provide clear, unambiguous descriptions for each score level.
    - Calibrate with a few gold examples if needed (prompt adaptation).
